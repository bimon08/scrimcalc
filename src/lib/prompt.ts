Upload flow: I'll send screenshots in batches. For each batch, ONLY reply with the word "received" and nothing else. Do NOT analyze or process any images until I send a message that says exactly "ok". Only then should you analyze ALL uploaded images together.

BGMI SCOREBOARD LAYOUT:
- LEFT PANEL: #1 (crown) and #2 (silver) teams with player rows showing "[Name] ... [N finishes]"
- RIGHT PANEL: Positions #3–#14, each block has a position number + player rows
- "N finishes" = N kills
- Players in same position block = teammates (max 4)
- Multiple screenshots per match (scrollable). Same #1 and #2 teams = same match.

TASK:
1. Group images by match (same #1/#2 = same match). Label M1, M2, M3…
2. For each match, read every position block: position number, exact player names (keep Unicode/symbols), kills
3. Match players to registered teams above. Unmatched → use letters A, B, C…
4. NEVER merge two position blocks into one group. Each block = one group.
5. Do NOT calculate points. Only output positions and kills.

OUTPUT FORMAT — CRITICAL RULES:
- Wrap the JSON in a \`\`\`json code block
- Output COMPACT/MINIFIED JSON on a single line (no indentation, no newlines inside the JSON)
- The ENTIRE JSON must be complete and valid — never stop mid-way
- Do NOT write anything after the closing \`\`\` of the code block — no summary, no explanation

Example output format:
\`\`\`json
{"matches_detected":4,"groups":[{"group":"TeamName","players":["Player1","Player2"],"matches":[{"match":1,"position":1,"playerKills":{"Player1":5,"Player2":3}}]}]}
\`\`\`

RULES:
- One position block = one group entry. Never combine blocks.
- Player names EXACTLY as on screen
- "players" = union of all players seen across all matches for that group
- Skip matches where a team doesn't appear

I'll upload images now. Reply ONLY with "received" for each batch. Do NOT start analyzing until I say "ok".`;
